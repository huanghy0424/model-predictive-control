# Model-Predictive-Control
To control a robot to move along a straight line by modeling it as a unicycle (thereby deriving a set of discrete-time dynamic equations), and optimizing the cost function over tracking accuracy and control effort with and without a feedback control.

Written as part of an assignment for ROB310 - Introduction to Robotics at the University of Toronto.
